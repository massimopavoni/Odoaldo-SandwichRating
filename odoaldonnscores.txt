Which is the best dataset for target scores? (target is unknown equal or under 5%)
Testing with 12 epochs, batch size 32

Oversampling
 - Train 0.0449
 - Validation 0.0570
 - Test 0.0551
 - Unknown 0.2502
Very good on test, but so so bad on unknown because of huge overfitting from oversampling

Undersampling
 - Train 0.2464
 - Validation 0.2240
 - Test 0.2436
 - Unknown 0.1971
Very good on unknown, but bad on its own test (that has never seen)


Averagesampling 
 - Train 0.0631
 - Validation 0.1016
 - Test 0.1026
 - Unknown 0.2423
Quite similar to the oversampling case, with a decent score on test (overfitting), but quite bad on unknown (could actually be a viable dataset solution for when there are less ratings images that need to be oversampled

Not balanced
 - Train 0.1478
 - Validation 0.1494
 - Test 0.1533
 - Unknown 0.2261
Not as bad as oversampling and averagesampling on unknown, but just a confirmation that the dataset should be balanced
